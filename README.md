## 🧭 My Journey

I started my academic path on the **premed track**, but along the way, I discovered a deep love for **mathematics**. To blend both passions, I majored in **Biomathematics**, which gave me the best of both worlds—mathematical rigor and biomedical relevance.

Since then, I've explored multiple domains, including **psychology**, **biomedical engineering**, and **quantitative finance**. I’m especially passionate about using data and modeling to solve real-world problems in healthcare and beyond.
